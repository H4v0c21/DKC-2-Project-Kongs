;as a convention, any unused address will be named UNUSED_<address> and treated as a single byte
;Most addresses shall be assumed 2 bytes unless otherwise noted.  Single byte addresses won't be specifically
;noted as their addresses will carry that point.
;Duplicate addresses imply an address withg multiple contexts.
;Temporaries are named after the address they point to rather than a sequence.
;Temporaries used for any significant context should have local reassignment
;Temporaries are generally any addres used in multi contexts.
